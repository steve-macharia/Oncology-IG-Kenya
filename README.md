Release Note: Oncology Implementation Guide - Kenya (2025) - Test Mode

The Oncology Implementation Guide for Kenya (2025) is now available in test mode. This guide is intended to support oncology data management in line with the Social Health Authority (SHA) policies, DHIS2, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. It integrates cancer reporting tools such as the KEMRI Cancer Registry, Nairobi Cancer Registry, Oncology Dispensing Tool (ODT), National Cancer Control Program (NCCP) Data Systems, and DHIS2. The guide includes detailed profiles for oncology patients, conditions, observations, medication requests, coverage, diagnostic reports, and cancer registry reporting. Please do not use this guide for production purposes as it is still in test mode. It is designed to assist in testing, validation, and refinement, and using it for production may lead to inaccurate data or integration. We are transforming Healthcare architecture. Together we can make Kenya to be a great country again.
